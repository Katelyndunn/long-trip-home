      <div class= "col-md-6"><p class= "paragraph">You decided to take the shortcut and as you walk past the same oak tree for the fourth time, you decide that you're lost. It turns out that the path your cousin taught you has slipped your memory and you have no idea where you are. You sit down and try to map out your options. Your first option is to try and figure it out. The brain is a powerful muscle, and if you sit down and relax for a little bit, the path will come to you and you can try figuring it out again. Or, you can give up and just call your mom. She's not going to be happy about coming out to the woods to find you, but at least you'll make it home safe.</p> </div>
