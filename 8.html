      <div class= "col-md-6"><p class= "paragraph">You decide to walk home and as you round the corner of your street, a huge guy in a ski mask orders you to empty your pockets, backpack and deposit all valuables into his makeshift pillowcase sack. You do as you're told and he runs across the street to his plate-less getaway car. You continue your walk home and as soon as you get into the house, your mom reads you ALL of your riot acts. As soon as she learns that your phone was stolen, she lectures you some more on the importance of the importance of responsibility and sends to you your room. </p> </div>
