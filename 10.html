      <div class= "col-md-6"><p class= "paragraph">You decide to hangout with your friends. It'll be really good to catch up with them. Things are going great and everyone is having a good time until someone suggests that you go rob the vacationing neighbor's house next door to where you are. Everyone agrees, and they turn to you for the final say. You don't want to do it, but you're having fun and you don't want the night to end. You go along with them and as soon as you enter the house, the alarm sounds and the police arrest you as you try to flee the scene. </p> </div>
