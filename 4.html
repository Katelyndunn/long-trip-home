      <div class= "col-md-6"><p class= "paragraph">After your 18th round of temple run, 2 hours have passed and you realize that you could've been home by now. It's getting darker and darker, but you have two choices. You can either walk home in the dark, or sleep at school. Walking home in the dark is very dangerous, but not much happens in your neighborhood. Your other option is to sleep at school. Your phone is dead and everyone has left by now. The shed in the back of the school is always left unlocked and no one will notice if you're in there.</p> </div>
